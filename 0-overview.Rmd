These slides are part of the course entitled 'Marine Community Ecology,' co-developed by **Dr. Simon J. Brandl** and **Dr. Jordan M. Casey** and taught at The University of Texas at Austin [Marine Science Institute](https://utmsi.utexas.edu/)

All materials for the coding part of the course were created by the author using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Slideshows were produced using the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

All photos used in these presentations were taken by Dr. Casey and all code was written from scratch by Dr. Brandl and Dr. Casey. All scripts, files, and images necessary to complete the coding exercises are provided on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/gobysimon) and [Github](https://github.com/simonjbrandl/mce2024).

# Format of coding lessons

All coding lessons are structured as follows:

1) Watch a pre-recorded lecture that introduces you to the packages, operations, and objectives of each coding lesson. The recording and the slides used for the presentation will be available on Canvas. 

2) Perform a set of relatively easy exercises at home, which are usually to be submitted as homework. We will go through their solutions in class.

3) Work through a set of harder exercises in class. This will allow you to work in groups and with your instructors to solve problems and  deepen your coding skills.
