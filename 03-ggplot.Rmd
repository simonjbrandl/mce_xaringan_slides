# The ggplot package `r emo::ji("artist_palette")`

.pull-left[
- stands for 'Grammar of Graphics'

- offers an extremely versatile set of functions to create beautiful data visualizations

- works with layers: data, aesthetics, geoms, axes, descriptions

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot2.png")

## The basic concept
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot-layers.png")
```

---
## The ggplot2 package `r emo::ji("package")`

.pull-left[
- the core package for tidy data processing is the **ggplot2** package

- there are many auxiliary packages that include specialized geoms, functions, etc., such as **ggridges**, **GGally**, or **ggeffects**

- other packages integrate with ggplot such as **patchwork** or **fishualize** `r emo::ji("heart_eyes")`
]

.pull-right[ .center[ .top[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fishualize_logo.png")
```

## Preparation

Let's read in datasets to use with our ggplot exploration 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
herbivore.traits <- read.csv(file = "data/coralreefherbivores.csv") 
head(herbivore.traits)
reef.fish <- read.csv(file = "data/reef_fishes.csv")
head(reef.fish)
```

# Getting started
---

## The <span style="color:orange">ggplot()</span> function

.pull-left[
- the <span style="color:orange">ggplot()</span> function will create your base layer

- you can think of this as a blank canvas

- not very exciting, but it's a start

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot()
```

]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Adding data `r emo::ji("chart_increasing")`

.pull-left[
- you can add data using the 'data()' argument

- this doesn't actually change anything in how the plot looks, but it directs the function to the dataset to use for all other arguments

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# use the herbivore.traits dataset
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits)
```

]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]

---
## Specifying aesthetics using aes()

.pull-left[
- aesthetics in ggplot (specified with the aes() argument) clarify which columns hold the information and how you want to use it

- let's say we want to look at the relationship between herbivore body depth (x) and eye diameter (y)

- as you can see, we now get axes on our graph that reflect our variables of interest

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter))
```

]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Adding geoms: scatterplots

.pull-left[
- with the blank canvas, the source data, and the aesthetics in place, we can actually show the patterns in the data

- since we're interested in a relationship between two continuous variables, we will use a scatterplot with geom_point()

- we can add and modify geoms by using **+** after each line

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter)) +
  geom_point()
```

- not exactly a work of art, but informative no less `r emo::ji("smiling_face_with_sunglasses")`
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Adjusting visual elements

.pull-left[
- we can easily modify the size, shape, and color of the plotted points

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# size changes size of the point
# shape changes the shape of the point
# color changes the color of the point
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, 
             shape = 18, 
             color = "blue")
```


]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Mapping groups onto geoms

.pull-left[
- it's often useful to use colors, shapes, or sizes to display group membership

- we can map groups onto geoms, but need to use the aes() mapping function

- this can be done either in the main aes() mapping or for each specific geom

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter,
# group membership assigned here
                 color = family)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5, 
             shape = 18) 
# no color argument here
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Multiple group aesthetics

.pull-left[
- we can use shapes, sizes, colors, or fills to indicate different group memberships

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family,
# added shape = size
                 shape = size)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5) 
# removed shape argument here
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Continuous group aesthetics

.pull-left[
- we can include a third continuous variable on the plot

- including more information isn't always better: this is a very busy plot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family,
                 shape = size,
# including sl as a continuous variable
                 size = sl)) +
  geom_point()
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]

---
## Facets

.pull-left[
- if there is too much information for one panel, we can tell ggplot to create multiple panels

- this is done using the facet_grid() or facet_wrap() argument

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family,
                 shape = size,
                 size = sl)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(. ~ family) 
```
]

# Summarizing data `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

## Data within groups

.pull-left[

- let's re-investigate the plot we made earlier

- if we focus on the y-axis, we see that that there may be a difference in eye diameter among the four families

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/threeherbs.jpg")
```

]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p1
```
]]
---
## Categorical axes

.pull-left[

- we can get a better sense for differences among groups by including a categorical axis

- this is very simple: you just need to specify a categorical column in aes()

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family)) +
  geom_point()
```

- it's not the best way of visualizing it
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p3
```
]]
---
## Jittering points

.pull-left[

- one way of making the plot clearer is by slightly adjusting ('jittering') each point

- this can be achieved using geom_jitter() instead of geom_point() `r emo::ji("beetle")`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
# specify the width you want to use
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p3
```
]]
---
## Boxplots

.pull-left[

- while jittering makes it easier to see, it is much better to visualize actual distributions in the four families 

- the easiest way of accomplishing this is with a boxplot `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 color = family)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

- by default, ggplots boxplots display the **median**, **1st and 3rd quartiles**, **1.5x the interquartile range**, and **outliers**
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p3
```
]]
---
## Filling boxes

.pull-left[

- the fill of the boxes is set to white by default

- we can use the 'fill' argument to change that

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 fill = family)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", notch = TRUE)
# notch = TRUE creates a notch ;-)
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F}
p3
```
]]
---
## Violin plots `r emo::ji("violin")`

.pull-left[

- instead of boxplots, we can also show the entire distribution with a violin plot

- we can easily specify the quantiles we want

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 fill = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05, 
                                 0.5, 
                                 0.95))
```

- since violins can't be made from a single data point, we are losing the Kyphosidae 
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p3
```
]]
---
## Overlaying multiple geoms

.pull-left[

- it is often useful to combine multiple geoms

- a distribution and its raw data together is called a 'sina plot'

```{r, echo = TRUE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter,
                 fill = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05, 
                                 0.5, 
                                 0.95)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p3
```
]]
---
## Density ridges

.pull-left[

- we can also display data as density curves, called ridges

- to do so, it's nice to change the x- and y-axis configuration

- it's also nice to adjust the transparency, which is done using the 'alpha' argument

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = F, message=FALSE}
p3 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = eyediameter, 
                 y = family,
                 fill = family)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1)
# note that we changed the jitter from width to height
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(p3)
```
]]
---
## Other distributional geoms `r emo::ji("ghost")`

- there are many other ways to plot distributions, including geoms such as <span style="color:orange">geom_histogram()</span>, <span style="color:orange">geom_density()</span>, or <span style="color:orange">geom_halfeye()</span>

# Uncertainty `r emo::ji("thinking_face")`

## Means and errors

- historically: barplots `r emo::ji("woozy_face")`

- we have to do some tidy data wrangling to get our data into this format

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = F, message=FALSE}
herbivore.trait.means <- herbivore.traits %>%
  group_by(family) %>%
  summarize(mean.eye = mean(eyediameter),
            sd.eye = sd(eyediameter), n = n()) %>%

                                  n - 1) * se.eye,
         upper.ci = mean.eye + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), 
                                  n - 1) * se.eye)

- ggplot's default colors are hideous

- we can specify our own colors using scale_fill() or scale_color()

- an overview of colors in R is [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)

```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05, 
                                 0.5, 
                                 0.95)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, color = "white", 
              alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", 
                               "yellowgreen", 
                               "darkorchid",
                               "goldenrod4"))
# colors specified by name
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p6
```
]]

## Changing shapes

.pull-left[
- similar to colors and fills, we can specify different shapes

- this is done using the scale_shape_manual() function

- not all shapes take fill arguments

- an overview of shapes in R is [here](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-point-shapes-best-tips/)

```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = family,
                 shape = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05,
                                 0.5,
                                 0.95)) + 
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", 
                               "yellowgreen", 
                               "darkorchid",
                               "goldenrod4")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21:24))
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p6
```
]]

## Using color palettes

.pull-left[
- palettes provide predefined color scales

- often important to specify whether you want discrete or continuous values

- example: viridis color palette

```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = family,
                 shape = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05,
                                 0.5,
                                 0.95)) + 
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21:24))
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p6
```
]]

## Fishualize `r emo::ji('heart_eyes')`

.pull-left[
- the [fishualize](https://nschiett.github.io/fishualize/articles/overview_colors.html) package provides color palettes based on fish colors

```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = family, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = family, 
                 shape = family)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.05,
                                 0.5,
                                 0.95)) + 
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_fish_d(option = "Centropyge_loricula")+
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21:24))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fishualize_logo.png")
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p6
```
]]

## Continuous color palettes

.pull-left[
```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = sl, shape = family)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_fish(option = "Trimma_lantana")+
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21:24))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Tlantana.png")
```

]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p6
```
]]

## Themes
.pull-left[
- use theme wrapper to modify the color of the background
  - **theme_bw()** - dark on light background, good for presentations
  - **theme_classic()** - includes x and y axis lines, but no gridlines
  - **theme_minimal()** - no background annotations


```{r}
p6 <- ggplot(data = herbivore.traits, 
             aes(x = bodydepth, 
                 y = eyediameter, 
                 fill = sl,
                 shape = family)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 3) +
  scale_fill_fish(option = "Trimma_lantana")+
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21:24)) +
  theme_classic()

## Preparation

.pull-left[
- sometimes it's useful to rescale your axes

- to explore this, we will use the reef.fish() dataset

- coral reef fishes: year of description, depth range, size, and whether they're considered a cryptobenthic or mobile reef fish.

```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
reef.fish <- read.csv(file = "data/reef_fishes.csv")
head(reef.fish)
```
]
---
## Rescaling


.pull-left[
- plot the relationship between year of description and body size

- body size, abundance, biomass, or species richness are often poorly distributed

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(reef.fish, aes(x = year, 
                            y = length)) +
                geom_point()
```

## `r emo::ji("face_vomiting")`
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p7
```
]]
---
## Using the log-scale

.pull-left[
- the log-scale is a useful transformation when data are exponentially distributed

- two options: transform first or in plot

- there's no log() of 'NA', so we have to remove NAs first

```{r}
reef.fish.na <- reef.fish %>%
  drop_na(length)

p7 <- ggplot(reef.fish, aes(x = year, 
                            y = length)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10()
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p7
```
]]
---
## Axis breaks and limits

.pull-left[
- we can control the ticks and labels

- let's flip the axes to make it more visually appealing

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(reef.fish, aes(x = length, 
                            y = year)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1755, 2015), 
                     breaks = seq(1755, 2015, 20)) + 
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b")
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p7
```
]]
---
## Labeling

.pull-left[
- easy to change the axis labels

- xlab() and ylab() for simple relabeling

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(reef.fish, aes(x = length, 
                            y = year)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1755, 2015), 
                     breaks = seq(1755, 2015, 20)) + 
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Body length (cm)") +
  ylab("Year of description")
```
]

.pull-right[ .center[
```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
p7
```
]]
---
## Legends

.pull-left[
- we can also manipulate the legend for grouping variables

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(reef.fish, aes(x = length, 
                            y = year,
                            color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1755, 2015), 
                     breaks = seq(1755, 2015, 20)) + 
  annotation_logticks(sides = "b") +
  xlab("Body length (cm)") +
  ylab("Year of description") +
  scale_color_fish_d(option = "Trimma_lantana",
                     name = "Fish category",
                     labels = c("Cryptobenthic", 
                                "Mobile"))

# Exercise 3.3 `r emo::ji("weight_lifting_woman")`

## Using the reef fish dataset:

### a) Create a boxplot with family on the y-axis and length on the x-axis, with the x-axis log-scaled

### b) Fill the boxes based on 'category' using the _Hypsypops rubicundus_ color palette from the fishualize package

### c) Change it to theme_bw() rename the axis labels to "Reef fish family" and "Length (cm)"
